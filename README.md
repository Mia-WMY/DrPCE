# DrPCE-Net: Differential Residual PCE Network for Characteristic Prediction of Transistors

## Introduction

🤔🤔🤔

This is the code implementation of the paper “DrPCE-Net: Differential Residual PCE Network for Characteristic Prediction of Transistors”

The structure of the project is as follows：

-- DrPCE-Net (the main method proposed)

-- PCE (the implementation of Polynomial Chaoes Expansion)

-- baseline1 (the implementation of Y-model referred in paper)

-- baseline2 (the implementation of W-model referred in paper)

-- data (the data used in the experiments including three datasets: circle, rectangle, triangle)

-- net (the implementation of DNN referred in paper)

-- plot  (the source code of partial figure plot)

-- results (the results of partial experiments)

-- tools (the basic code of some function)


## Requirements

🥸🥸🥸

This project bases on Python 3.10.8

More information about packages can be found in **requirements.txt**.



## Usage

😇😇😇

Taking the **DrPCE-Net** as an example, you can train and test the model using the following command:
>**cd DrPCE-Net**

>**python shell.py**

By executing it , you will get a directory of prediction, and you can view the **report.txt** to get an overview of the total prediction.
